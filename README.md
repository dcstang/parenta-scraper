## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Download for Your Computer
Choose your operating system:

| Windows | macOS | Linux |
|---------|-------|-------|
| [📥 Download Windows](../../releases/latest/download/ParentaScraper-Windows.zip) | [📥 Download Mac](../../releases/latest/download/ParentaScraper-Mac.dmg) | [📥 Download Linux](../../releases/latest/download/ParentaScraper-Linux.tar.gz) |
| Windows 10/11 | macOS 10.15+ | Ubuntu/Fedora/etc |

### 2. Install Google Chrome (Required)
The app uses Chrome to access your nursery account safely.

**Don't have Chrome?** → [Download Chrome here](https://www.google.com/chrome/)

### 3. Run the App
- **Windows**: Extract the ZIP → Double-click `ParentaScraper.exe`
- **Mac**: Open the DMG → Drag to Applications → Run
- **Linux**: Extract the tar.gz → Run `./ParentaScraper`

**Mac specific instructions** 
There is an error which is expected when executing from macOS (unknown developer error). Unfortunately it would take rather long for the full verification process from Apple, plus an additional $99 licensing cost on my end. The quickest way is to bypass this on your own Mac. Please follow the following seven step instructions.

1. Find the downloaded installer (likely on desktop)

2. Double-click on the installer and then double-click the Python app within

3. You will see a security warning. This is expected. Click "Done"
![Mac Step 3](screenshots/mac3.png)

4. Go to "Launchpad" on the dock (the icon with 9 squares and different colors) → then, "System Settings"

## For Parents, By Parents

This app was created by a parent who wanted an easy way to download their child's nursery photos. 

**Why we built this:**
- Nursery portals don't offer bulk download; no decomissioning process
- Manually saving hundreds of photos takes hours
- Parents deserve to own their child's memories

## Technical Details

<summary>For the technically curious...</summary>

- Built with Python and CustomTkinter
- Uses Selenium WebDriver for nursery portal automation
- Parallel downloading for speed
- Cross-platform PyInstaller executables
- Automatic ChromeDriver management
- JavaScript-based data extraction for performance
